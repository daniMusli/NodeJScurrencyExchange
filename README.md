# NodeJScurrencyExchange
A live currency exchange API written with Node.js 

this project was done to request live currency exchange rates from a link that returns data in JSON form 
here i used a free service which provide limited time access to the service so this link wont stay up for long 
you can get your own free key from similar API providers and try it.
this project was written using [Node.jsÂ®](https://nodejs.org/en/)
